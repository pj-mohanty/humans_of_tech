      "contribution": "Alan Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science. He formalised the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which serves as a model for general-purpose computers. He also worked on German naval cryptanalysis during World War II, speeding up the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bomba method. Post-war, he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. He further developed the Manchester computers and wrote on the chemical basis of morphogenesis.",
      "importance": "Turing is considered the father of theoretical computer science and his work in cryptanalysis during WW II played a crucial role in defeating the Axis powers in many critical engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic. He left an extensive legacy in mathematics and computing. Turing's work is recognised widely today, with many things named after him, including an annual award for computing innovation. His portrait appears on the Bank of England £50 note.",
      "politicalInfluence": "Turing was prosecuted for homosexual acts in 1952 and accepted hormone treatment, a form of chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. His treatment led to an official public apology by British Prime minister Gordon Brown in 2009. Queen Elizabeth II granted a pardon in 2013. The 'Alan Turing law' is an informal term for a 2017 UK law that retroactively pardoned men cautioned or convicted under historical legislation that outlawed homosexual acts."

      "contribution": "Grace Hopper was a pioneer of computer programming and was the first to devise the theory of machine-independent programming languages. She used this theory to develop the FLOW-MATIC programming language and COBOL, an early high-level programming language still in use today. She was also one of the first programmers on the Harvard Mark I computer and is credited with writing the first computer manual, 'A Manual of Operation for the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator.'",
      "importance": "Hopper played a significant role in the development of modern computer languages. Her work paved the way for using English-based language in code, making programming more accessible. She was instrumental in the creation of COBOL, which is still in use today and served as the foundation for many modern programming languages. Her belief that programming should be simplified with an English-based computer programming language led her to develop compilers that could convert English terms into machine code understood by computers.",
      "politicalInfluence": "Hopper's influence extended to the United States Navy, where she reached the rank of rear admiral. The U.S. Navy named a guided-missile destroyer, the USS Hopper, in her honor. Additionally, a supercomputer and a GPU architecture bear her name, signaling her impact and influence in the field of computing technology."

      "contribution": "Ada Lovelace is chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation. Between 1842 and 1843, Lovelace translated an article about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of seven notes, simply called 'Notes'. Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, especially the seventh one which contained what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Lovelace also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching. The programming language Ada is named after her.",
      "importance": "Ada Lovelace's work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, is considered significantly influential in the field of computer science. She was the first to realise and propose that such machines had applications beyond pure calculation, and her 'Notes' that accompanied her translation of an article about the Analytical Engine form an important part in computer history. They contain what is considered by many to be the first computer program. Lovelace's vision of the capacity of computers to go beyond mere calculation was remarkable at a time when many, including Babbage, focused only on these capabilities.",
      "politicalInfluence": "Regarded as the first computer programmer, Lovelace’s foresight about the potential of computing inspired the recognition of computing as more than mere calculation. Her legacy has influenced movements for gender diversity in STEM, as well as policies emphasizing ethical and interdisciplinary approaches to technology development."
