## Project overview

Title: Humans of Technology - an exploration of the Politics and History of Computer Science
Central Idea: an interactive History Museum of important figures in the field of computer science. The site allows users to connect with historical figures through a brief history of their contributions to Computer Science, the importance of their work in the field, and their political influence in the world more broadly. Allow the user to chat with these historical figures via an OpenAI API-based chatbot.

## Data Description:

A front page of the functionalities of the museum, the central focus being a list of “cards” with names, pictures, and descriptions of historically important people.
A JSON file of names, pictures, and descriptions of several historically-important people in the field of Computer Science, with information taken mostly from Wikipedia, and partially from ChatGPT.

## AI Description:
Parts:
Used OpenAI API to parse Wikipedia API responses to create the JSON file described above 
Used OpenAI API to create AI chatbots of each person with independent chat histories
