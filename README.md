# Humans_of_Technology
Andy Bainton, Padmaja Mohanty - CS514 - Final Project Proposal
Link to Frontend: https://cs-514-project-5-frontend.wl.r.appspot.com

## Project overview

Title: Humans of Technology - an exploration of the Politics and History of Computer Science
Central Idea: an interactive History Museum of important figures in the field of computer science. The site allows users to connect with historical figures through a brief history of their contributions to Computer Science, the importance of their work in the field, and their political influence in the world more broadly. Allow the user to chat with these historical figures via an OpenAI API-based chatbot.

## Data Description:

A front page of the functionalities of the museum, the central focus being a list of “cards” with names, pictures, and descriptions of historically important people.
A JSON file of names, pictures, and descriptions of several historically-important people in the field of Computer Science, with information taken mostly from Wikipedia, and partially from ChatGPT.

## AI Description:
Parts:
Used OpenAI API to parse Wikipedia API responses to create the JSON file described above 
Used OpenAI API to create AI chatbots of each person with independent chat histories

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
